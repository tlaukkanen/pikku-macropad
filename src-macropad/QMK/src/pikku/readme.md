# QMK For Pikku Macropad

This firmware adds support for [VIAL](vial.rocks) for easy configuration of the macropad. 

The code currently have default names for the layers based on the original firmware, and changing them is easy but requires re-compilation of the firmware and re-flashing.

To compile, I recommend following [This file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8pdUPqPG3k) , as it requires a different fork of QMK for the VIAL support.

For more information about QMK, see the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.
